OFF type is designed to turn OFF transgene expression when a specific microRNA binds to the binding site on the switch. On the other hand, ON type is designed to turn ON transgene expression when a specific microRNA binds to the binding site on the switch. RNA switch can have multiple microRNA binding sites tandemly and make programmable mRNA therapy such as NOT/OR conditions by designing the microRNA binding sites. As an example, the OFF type can reduce liver expression by turning off transgene in response to liver-specific microRNAs, while the ON type can turn on therapeutic transgene in response to microRNAs specific to disease-associated cells, such as cancer cells.",Preclinical

We have demonstrated the efficacy of our therapy using mice bearing subcutaneous prostate mouse tumors, i.e. our treatment leads to full tumor disappearance in all treated mice without tumor regrowth at 6 months. It is also safe, due to moderate heating conditions (43°-45°) and to the use of completely natural/non-toxic nanoparticles. The treatment can be carried out in an ambulatory fashion, i.e. it does not require general anesthesia nor the use of the operation theatre, or a surgeon or radiotherapist. Beside these advantages, the therapy has a low cost of fabrication (250 euros/patient), which would potentially make it available to the large percentage of patients suffering from prostate tumors who can’t be treated today due to a too high treatment cost or a lack of access to hospitals.","VC/PE, Angel or Family Office, Hedge Fund/Mutual Fund, Tech Transfer, Research Institute, Foundation/Patient Advocacy, Incubator/Technology Park, Associations"

At Pandorum, we have developed a technology platform to develop exosomes with tunable cargos from clinical grade Mesenchymal Stem Cells (with existing Drug Master File at USFDA) in a scalable and consistent manner. Using specific inducers, we can optimize the properties of these exosomes, such as, anti-inflammatory, anti-fibrotic, anti-angiogenic, neurogenesis to fit the need of a specific tissue and disease indication, such as cornea, liver and beyond. Our flagship product Kuragenx - the 'Liquid' Cornea, combines exosomes containing specialized cargos delivered with cornea-mimetic biopolymers to promote corneal tissue regeneration. Kuragenx can be visualized as a transparent viscous liquid that is administered dropwise to the excavated wound site after the corneal surgeon removes the diseased tissue. The liquid spreads, solidifies within a few minutes under visible light and helps to grow a new cornea in less than a year. Kuragenx was developed using quantitative experimental data including in vitro and in vivo studies to ‘map’ various tissue-states in order to assess the effectiveness of the treatment. Studies in New Zealand rabbits suffering from Neurotrophic Keratitis have demonstrated restoration of healthy cornea with neuronal plexus within three months post-treatment, paving the way to treat patients suffering from unmet clinical needs. Kuragenx has been assigned by USFDA to the Office of Tissues and Advanced Therapies, and our First in Human clinical study is planned in 2024, to treat advanced keratitis- a severe indication with unmet medical needs.","Preclinical, Clinical, VC/PE, Angel or Family Office"
